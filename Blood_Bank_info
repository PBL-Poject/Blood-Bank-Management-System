A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion.
However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, and indeed some hospitals also perform collection. 
Blood banking includes tasks related to blood collection, processing, testing, separation, and storage.


Types of blood transfused
Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. 
As of 2019, a total of 38 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT).
The two most important blood group systems are ABO and Rh; they determine someone's blood type (A, B, AB, and O, with +, − or null denoting RhD status) for suitability in blood transfusion.
Whole blood which is blood without separation. red blood cells or packed cells is transfused to patients with anaemia/iron deficiency.
It also helps to improve the oxygen saturation in blood. It can be stored at 1.0 °C-6.0 °C for 35–45 days.
Platelet transfusion, is transfused to those who suffer from low platelet count. Platelets can be stored at room temperature for up to 5–7 days. 

Collection and processing:
In the U.S., certain standards are set for the collection and processing of each blood product.
The less-dense blood plasma is made into a variety of frozen components, and is labeled differently based on when it was frozen and what the intended use of the product is.
